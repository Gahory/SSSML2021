    <h5>Submission instructions</h5>
    <p>
        <b>Q: What types of contributions are accepted?</b>
        <br/>This workshop accepts regular research papers within 6 pages, short papers within 4 pages and position papers within 2 pages.
        <br/>Submitted papers must conform to the two-column IEEE conference publication format. Templates for LaTeX and Microsoft Word are available from http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html: please use the letter format template and conference option.
        <br/>Papers should be submitted in the PDF format: they must not exceed page limit. Submissions will be handled via EasyChair. Papers must neither have been previously accepted for publication nor be under submission in another conference or journal. For your paper to be published in the proceedings, at least one of the authors of the paper must register for the conference and confirm that she/he will present the paper in person.
        <br/><b>Describe the review and evaluation process to decide which submissions to accept:</b> All papers will be evaluated in terms of the following criteria:
        <li><b>Originality or potential for impact:</b> The submission presents a particularly novel collation of historical work, insight or approach towards new/future work, and/or is potentially disruptive of current practice or common knowledge.</li>
        <li><b>Soundness:</b> The submission makes a coherent argument, substantiated by historical analysis, cogent analytical argument, or appropriately-scoped initial empirical results.</li>
        <li><b>Relevance:</b> The submission appropriately considers and puts itself in context with respect to the relevant literature.</li>
        <br/>Specific topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following subject categories:
        <li>Testing and verification of Advanced Driving Assistant Systems</li>
        <li>Robustness, adversarial attack, defense in Advanced Driving Assistant Systems</li>
        <li>Defects, errors, failures, defects, bugs of Advanced Driving Assistant Systems</li>
        <li>Availability and safety of Advanced Driving Assistant Systems</li>
        <li>System and software security of Advanced Driving Assistant Systems</li>
        <li>Hardware reliability of Advanced Driving Assistant Systems</li>
        <li>Systems (software and hardware) engineering of Advanced Driving Assistant Systems</li>
        <li>AI and Advanced Driving Assistant Systems</li>
        <li>Quality Assurance of Advanced Driving Assistant Systems</li>
        <li>Traffic Engineering for reliability of Advanced Driving Assistant Systems</li>
        <li>Human computer interaction issues in Advanced Driving Assistant Systems</li>
        <li>Empirical studies on Advanced Driving Assistant Systems</li>
        <li>Industry best practices</li>
    </p>

    <h5>Expected Participation</h5>
    <p>We expect to attract researchers and practitioners from either reliability or advanced driving assistant system communities to attend the RADAS. The ballpark estimate of the number of participants is 20-30 attendees. We also expect to take in around 12 submissions and eventually 3-4 accepted papers would warrant publication. As the RADAS is the first start-up workshop connecting reliability and autopilot techniques, we hope that the fairly competitive acceptance rate would facilitate high-quality submissions, to eventually build up the workshop to be the home of crossover areas of reliability and advanced driving assistant system.</p>
