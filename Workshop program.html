    <h5>Theme</h5>
    <p>The theme of the workshop is to leverage traditional reliability techniques to better understand advanced driving assistant system and draw strong connections between the two. We aim to apply reliability methods to accomplish the tasks such as failure prediction for advanceddriving assistant system, as well as advance and complement the existing reliability theory and practice for AI-Intensive System.</p>

    <h5>Goals</h5>
    <p>Our main goal is to shed light on the direction of applying the principles of reliability theory and methods to advanced driving assistant system and therefore evaluate the robustness of autopilot techniques especially AI-based techniques. The workshop also aims to leverage reliability techniques to advance the efficiency, accuracy, effectiveness, and usefulness of current autopilot techniques.</p>
    
    <h5>Relevance</h5>
    <p>The audience of ISSRE focuses on general reliability issues of hardware/software systems, which is highly related and would be benefited by leveraging the reliability techniques for advanced driving assistant system. In addition, it would be helpful for the ISSRE community to know at what aspect the reliability theory and methodology should be improved for the AI-Intensive System (e.g., autopilot systems) and make a broader impact to the community.</p>
